        <p>That said, the first thing that comes to mind when you think of the Iberian Peninsula is the seaside. And for good reason—the best beaches in Spain are unlike anything else in the world.</p>
        <p>Here’s a mental picture: you’re enjoying a mesmerizing morning tour of the Sagrada Familia Cathedral in Barcelona, or maybe the City of Arts and Sciences in Valencia. Then, you wash it down with a glass of Priorat wine at noon. At that point, the next logical step is to take a short drive to the coast and bask in the sun with salt in your hair.</p>
<p>Sounds like a good deal, right? Read on to see the most beautiful beaches in Spain!</p>

<!--San Juan Playa (Alicante)-->
<div class="place-block" id="place1">
<h3>San Juan Playa (Alicante)</h3>
<img src="images/San Juan Playa (Alicante).jpg" alt="">
<ul>
<li><b>Distance from City Center:</b> 🚗 6.2 miles (🕞 20 minutes)</li>
<li><b>Accommodation:</b> 🛏️ <a href="https://www.alicantehotelcastilla.com/" target="_blank">Hotel Castilla Alicante</a></li>
<li><b>Restaurants & Bars:</b> 🍽️ <a href="https://restaurantecasajulio.es/" target="_blank">Restaurante Casa Julio,</a> 🍸 <a href="https://www.instagram.com/xevenbeach/?hl=en" target="_blank">Xeven Beach Bar</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Alicante is famous for its incredible nightlife, but it’s also one of the best beach cities in Spain. The entire San Juan neighborhood is a favorite among tourists, thanks to attractions like the <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1064230-d1808500">Castell de Santa Bàrbera</a> and the bustling <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1064230-d1808500" target="_blank">Central Market</a>.</p>
<p>As for San Juan Beach, it’s the place to be if you enjoy sports by the water, be it mini-football, volleyball, or paddleboarding. There are also heaps of children’s playgrounds if you’re traveling with family!</p>
<p>Once you’ve had your fill of swimming and sunbathing, you have the <a href="https://fontanacc.es/" target="_blank">Centre Comercial Fontana</a> mall a hop and a skip away. The perfect place to get some souvenirs from your trip!</p>
<p>The beach is fairly far from the center of Alicante, so it’s a lot less touristy than a lot of our other picks. This makes it the perfect place to immerse yourself in Spanish culture and enjoy the day mostly surrounded by locals.</p>

<!--Playa de la Malvarrosa (Valencia)-->
<div class="place-block" id="place2">
<h3>Playa de la Malvarrosa (Valencia)</h3>
<img src="images/Playa de la Malvarrosa (Valencia).jpg" alt="">

<li><b>Distance from City Center:</b> 🚗 4.3 miles (🕞 25 minutes)</li>
<li><b>Accommodation:</b> 🛏️ <a href="https://elcoso.es/coso-del-mar/" target="_blank">El Coso</a></li>
<li><b>Restaurants & Bars:</b> 🍽️ <a href="https://www.casa-carmela.com/es/en/home/" target="_blank">asa Carmela</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Valencia has a reputation for being a party city, and it definitely doesn’t disappoint in the beach department, either. Playa de la Malvarossa stretches out for over two miles, and it’s almost always packed with tourists, for good reason too.</p>
<p>There’s lots of public transport leading here from all over Valencia—you almost get the sense the entire city is planned around Malvarrosa. Right along the beach is one of the most bustling waterfronts in the country, full of restaurants, shops, and places to spend the night. </p>
<p>Visiting this place with your better half? Just south of the beach is Valencia’s marina, which is the starting point of a once-in-a-lifetime <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g187529-d32863452" target="_blank">evening cruise</a>. Nothing like a glass of sangria to round off a day at one of Spain’s finest beaches!</p>

<!--Platja de Sant Sebastià (Barcelona)-->
<div class="place-block" id="place3">
<h3>Platja de Sant Sebastià (Barcelona)</h3>
<img src="images/Platja de Sant Sebastià (Barcelona).jpg" alt="">
<ul>
<li><b>Distance from City Center:</b> 🚗 1.2 miles (🕞 10 minutes)</li>
<li><b>Accommodation:</b> 🛏️ <a href="https://hostalportugal.com/en/" target="_blank">Hostal Portugal</a></li>
<li><b>Restaurants & Bars:</b>  🍽️ <a href="https://www.privateaser.es/local/52739-sea-breeze-beach-house" target="_blank">Restaurante Sea Breeze Beach House,</a> 🍸 <a href="https://www.instagram.com/barnabeachbar/" target="_blank">Barna Beach Bar</a></li>
</ul>
<p>One of the best beaches in Spain, Platja de Sant Sebastià also happens to be one of Barcelona’s oldest. If you don’t pay a visit to this place, you can’t really say you’ve been to Catalonia at all—fifteen minutes along the shore is enough to understand why!</p>
<p>Straight off the promenade, which has enough stuff to keep you busy for days if not weeks, you’ll set foot on a nearly mile-long beach with every amenity under the sun. Making matters more epic, you can see the legendary W Barcelona hotel from anywhere in the region, looming larger than life over thousands of beachgoers!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187497-d3782382" target="_blank">Rambla del Mar</a> is one of the most gorgeous walkways you’ll ever come across, and Barcelona’s Old Port is arguably the most beautiful sight in the city (and there’s no shortage of those!)</p>
<p>Just bear in mind that this place is packed with tourists, and Barcelona’s reputation precedes it. There are definitely overpriced restaurants you’ll want to avoid here, so use your best judgment, and you’ll fall in love with Barcelona before you know it!</p>

<!--Playa de Rodas (Cíes Islands)-->
<div class="place-block" id="place4">
<h3>Playa de Rodas (Cíes Islands)</h3>
<img src="images/Playa de Rodas (Cíes Islands).jpg" alt="">
<ul>
<li><b>Distance from City Center:</b>  🛥️ Accessible from Vigo (🕞 45 minutes)</li>
<li><b>Accommodation:</b> 🛏️ <a href="https://www.hesperia.com/hotel-hesperia-vigo/?utm_source=GMBvigo&utm_medium=organic" target="_blank">Hotel Hesperia</a></li>
<li><b>Restaurants & Bars:</b> 🍽️ <a href="https://restauranterodas.es/en/" target="_blank">Restaurante Rodas </a></li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the best beaches in Spain might be a little out of your way, but Playa de Rodas is absolutely worth the detour. You can get from <a href="https://www.misterferry.com/en/islands-of-galicia/ferries-vigo-cies.aspx" target="_blank">Vigo to the Cíes Islands by ferry</a> in under an hour, and you’ll have a pretty hard time packing up to leave!</p>
<p>One of the most popular beaches in Galicia, this place is known for its snowy-white sands and some of the clearest water in the Atlantic Ocean. It’s also famous for attracting huge flocks of cormorants and yellow-legged seagulls—it’s a beautiful sight, although you should make sure your food is carefully packed!</p>
<p>Best of all, there are only so many ferries that travel here daily. This means the beach will never be overcrowded or noisy, so it’s perfect if you need your peace and quiet. After you’ve gone for a swim, you can enjoy a breathtaking hike along the <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/spain/pontevedra/illas-cies-o-monte-faro" target="_blank">Monte Faro,</a> a forgiving trail with an unforgettable view of the beach. </p>

<!--Platja d'Aiguablava (Costa Brava)
-->
<div class="place-block" id="place5">
<h3>Platja d'Aiguablava (Costa Brava)</h3>
<img src="images/Platja d'Aiguablava (Costa Brava).jpg" alt="">
<ul>
<li><b>Distance from City Center:</b> 🚗 3.5 miles from Begur (🕞 10 minutes)</li>
<li><b>Accommodation:</b> 🛏️ <a href="https://www.hotelhostalillo.com/es/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=google-my-business&utm_content=google-my-business" target="_blank">Hotel Hostalillo</a> (Girona), 🛏️ <a href="https://hostaletdebegur.com/" target="_blank">Hostalet de Begur</a> (Begur)</li>
<li><b>Restaurants & Bars:</b> 🍽️ <a href="https://www.tocalmar.cat/" target="_blank">Toc al Mar</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This bay is technically not part of any city, with Begur and Girona being the nearest major hubs. That said, if you’re in the Catalonia region, driving here will reward you with one of the best beaches in Spain. </p>
<p>Since it’s a bit off the beaten path, this is one of the country’s best-preserved beaches. You’ll usually find the Costa Brava region full of people enjoying their afternoon with family, so while it can get crowded, it’s a far cry from some of the big city beaches in terms of noise.</p>
<p>Besides being a great spot for snorkeling (thanks to the crystal-clear water), the legendary Camí de Ronda trail passes through here. It’s a great way to hike to Begur or even southward, if you have the stamina for it!</p>

<!--Cala Comte (Ibiza)-->
<div class="place-block" id="place6">
<h3>Cala Comte (Ibiza)</h3>
<img src="images/Cala Comte (Ibiza).jpg" alt="">
<ul>
<li><b>Distance from City Center:</b> 🚗 6 miles (🕞 15 minutes)</li>
<li><b>Accommodation:</b> 🛏️ <a href="https://www.cansaliahotel.com/" target="_blank">Hotel Can Salia</a> (Cala de Bou), 🛏️ <a href="https://www.hotelpuchet.com/en/home/" target="_blank">Hotel Puchet</a> (Sant Antoni de Portmany)</li>
<li><b>Restaurants & Bars:</b> 🍽️ <a href="https://www.sunsetashram.com/en/" target="_blank">Sunset Ashram</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Located in the southwest of Ibiza, Cala Comte is one of the best ways to experience the island. Cala de Bou is the nearest place you can find hotels in, and it sets the atmosphere for this beach perfectly if you’re looking for something more subdued (by Ibiza standards).</p>
<p>The beach is a little rocky at certain spots, but it more than makes up for it with one of the best sunset views Spain has to offer. Not to mention, the turquoise water makes it ideal for paddleboarding, or even just zoning out as you watch the schools of fish zooming across the sea!</p>
<p>Also, if you’re going to come here, you’ll inevitably end up grabbing a meal or drink at the <b>Sunset Ashram.</b> This restaurant overlooking the beach is one of the most unique in Europe, boasting a chic-Bohemian aesthetic and reasonable prices for the island.</p>
<p>While it’s nowhere near as congested as the capital, it’s worth remembering that Ibiza can draw <a href="https://hotelagio.com/ibiza-tourism-statistics/" target="_blank">over 3 million tourists</a> a year. This means you can expect crowds no matter when you visit, but what you get makes it all worth it. </p>

<!--Playa de la Concha (San Sebastián)-->
<div class="place-block" id="place7">
<h3>Playa de la Concha (San Sebastián)</h3>
<img src="images/Playa de la Concha (San Sebastián).jpg" alt="">
<ul>
<li><b>Distance from City Center:</b> 🚗  Centra</li>
<li><b>Accommodation:</b> 🛏️ <a href="Hotel de Londres" target="_blank">El Coso</a></li>
<li><b>Restaurants & Bars:</b> 🍹 <a href="https://restaurante-biarritz.es/en/restaurant/" target="_blank">Bar & Restaurant Biarritz</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If there’s one thing you’ve heard about San Sebastián, it’s probably the iconic railing along La Concha Bay. And yes, it’s beautiful, but that’s only the tip of the iceberg for Playa de la Concha, one of the most beautiful beaches in Spain and beyond.</p>
<p>This beach isn’t just part of San Sebastián—it blends seamlessly into the urban backdrop. Flanked by the <a href="https://catedralbuenpastor.org/en/welcome/" target="_blank">Cathedral of the Good Pastor</a> (one of the country’s most beautiful pieces of architecture) and the historic <a href="https://www.miramar.eus/" target="_blank">Miramir Jauregia Palace</a>, Playa de la Concha is one of the most action-packed places to spend an afternoon.</p>
<p>As you might expect, what is widely considered Europe’s best beach can be a bit heavy on the pocket. Not to mention, you’ll be in the very center of the city. Don’t hesitate to chat up the friendly locals and figure out the best way to manage your funds if you want to experience this place on a budget!</p>

<!--Cala Major (Palma)-->
<div class="place-block" id="place8">
<h3>Cala Major (Palma)</h3>
<img src="images/Cala Major (Palma).jpg" alt="">
<ul>
<li><b>Distance from City Center:</b> 🚗 4.9 miles (🕞 10 minutes)</li>
<li><b>Accommodation:</b> 🛏️ <a href="https://www.hotelmallorcanixepalace.com/en/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=my_business" target="_blank">Hotel Nixe Palace, <a href="https://www.eurostarshotels.com/eurostars-marivent.html?referer_code=lb0gg00yx&utm_source=google&utm_medium=business&utm_campaign=lb0gg00yx" target="_blank"></a></li>
<li><b>Restaurants & Bars:</b> 🍽️ <a href="https://www.casa-carmela.com/es/en/home/" target="_blank">asa Carmela</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The largest of the 150 Balearic Islands, Mallorca is also home to Cala Major, one of the best beach resorts in Spain. Situated in the beautiful city of Palma, this pricey but beautiful beach is known for its glimmering sands and an unforgettable sea view.</p>
<p>This isn’t one of those beaches that extend on and on for miles, but it doesn’t need to be. Palma is the definition of a walkable city, and a lot of what you’ll want to see is right by the sea. For starters, you can do the classic kayaking and paddleboarding, or take a ten-to-fifteen-minute walk to Port Cala Nova if you’re into yachting or jet skiing. </p>
<p>Mallorca is the epitome of Spanish beauty and it draws in a lot of visitors, so many sections of this resort are loud and proud of it. If you’re a partygoer or simply enjoy being surrounded by lively people, Cala Major Beach is hard to beat!</p>
